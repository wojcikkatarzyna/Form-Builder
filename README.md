# Form-Builder

Form builder made with React, webpack.
It generates a form for users to fill out. Next, it allows the user to preview it and exports the structure as JSON.

Project is not completed.
Main problem is about add more than one level of sub-inputs.

To run project locally use commands:

npm install

./node_modules/.bin/webpack

./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --inline --hot
